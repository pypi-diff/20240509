 class Booklet(MutableMapping):
     """
+    Open a persistent dictionary for reading and writing. On creation of the file, the serializers will be written to the file. Any subsequent reads and writes do not need to be opened with any parameters other than file_path and flag (unless a custom serializer is passed).
+
+    Parameters
+    -----------
+    file_path : str or pathlib.Path
+        It must be a path to a local file location. If you want to use a tempfile, then use the name from the NamedTemporaryFile initialized class.
+
+    flag : str
+        Flag associated with how the file is opened according to the dbm style. See below for details.
+
+    write_buffer_size : int
+        The buffer memory size in bytes used for writing. Writes are first written to a block of memory, then once the buffer if filled up it writes to disk. This is to reduce the number of writes to disk and consequently the CPU write overhead.
+        This is only used when the file is open for writing.
+
+    key_serializer : str, class, or None
+        The serializer to use to convert the input value to bytes. Run the booklet.available_serializers to determine the internal serializers that are available. None will require bytes as input. A custom serializer class can also be used. If the objects can be serialized to json, then use orjson or msgpack. They are super fast and you won't have the pickle issues.
+        If a custom class is passed, then it must have dumps and loads methods.
+
+    value_serializer : str, class, or None
+        Similar to the key_serializer, except for the values.
+
+    n_bytes_file : int
+        The number of bytes to represent an integer of the max size of the file. For example, the default of 4 can allow for a file size of ~4.3 GB. A value of 5 can allow for a file size of 1.1 TB. You shouldn't need a bigger value than 5...
+
+    n_bytes_key : int
+        The number of bytes to represent an integer of the max length of each key.
+
+    n_bytes_value : int
+        The number of bytes to represent an integer of the max length of each value.
+
+    n_buckets : int
+        The number of hash buckets to put all of the kay hashes for the "hash table". This number should be at least ~2 magnitudes under the max number of keys expected to be in the db. Below ~3 magnitudes then you'll get poorer read performance. Just keep the number of buckets at approximately the number of keys you expect to have.

 Notice that you don't need to pass serializer parameters when reading (and additional writing) when in-built serializers are used. Booklet stores this info on the initial file creation.
 
-In most cases, the user should use python's context manager "with" when reading and writing data. This will ensure data is properly written and (optionally) locks are released on the file.

 TODO
 -----
-I need to write a lot more tests for the functionality.
-
-I would like to have the ability to prune files (i.e. remove old stale data from the file to shorten the file length). Unfortunately, the current file structure makes it extremely difficult to perform. A future version might have a different structure to support this better, but at the moment this kind of functionality is very minor. If a pruned file is desired, you can simply iterate through all of the keys and values to create a new file.
+Starting in version 0.1.8, there is a prune method. It removes "deleted" keys and values from the file, but it currently leaves the old indeces in the hash table. The old indeces should generally not cause a performance issue (and definitely not a file size issue), but it would be nice to have these removed as part of the prune method one day.
 
 
 Benchmarks
 -----------
 From my initial tests, the performance is comparable to other very fast key-value databases (e.g. gdbm, lmdb).
 Proper benchmarks will be coming soon...

 Introduction

-Booklet is a pure python key-value file database. It allows for multiple serializers for both the keys and values. The API is designed to use all of the same python dictionary methods python programmers are used to in addition to the typical dbm methods.
+Booklet is a pure python key-value file database. It allows for multiple serializers for both the keys and values. The API uses the MutableMapping class which is the same python dictionary methods python programmers are used to in addition to the typical dbm methods (e.g. sync and prune).
+It is thread-safe (using thread locks on writes), but only multiprocessing safe for linux users (using flock for locking files on open for writes).

 Notice that you don't need to pass serializer parameters when reading (and additional writing) when in-built serializers are used. Booklet stores this info on the initial file creation.
 
-In most cases, the user should use python's context manager "with" when reading and writing data. This will ensure data is properly written and (optionally) locks are released on the file. If the context manager is not used, then the user must be sure to run the db.sync() at the end of a series of writes to ensure the data has been fully written to disk.

 TODO
 -----
-I need to write a lot more tests for the functionality.
-
-I would like to have the ability to prune files (i.e. remove old stale data from the file to shorten the file length). Unfortunately, the current file structure makes it extremely difficult to perform. A future version might have a different structure to support this better, but at the moment this kind of functionality is very minor. If a pruned file is desired, you can simply iterate through all of the keys and values to create a new file.
+Starting in version 0.1.8, there is a prune method. It removes "deleted" keys and values from the file, but it currently leaves the old indeces in the hash table. The old indeces should generally not cause a performance issue (and definitely not a file size issue), but it would be nice to have these removed as part of the prune method one day.
 
 
 Benchmarks
 -----------
 From my initial tests, the performance is comparable to other very fast key-value databases (e.g. gdbm, lmdb).
 Proper benchmarks will be coming soon...
